== DESCRIPTION:

Matahari is a test spy library, heavily inspired by Java's Mockito and btakita's RR.

It is designed to allow you to test interactions between objects *without* requiring
you to specify all method calls, including uninteresting ones.

== SYNOPSIS:

  require 'matahari'

  describe "my object" do
    obj = MyAwesomeObject.new
    collaborator = spy(:collaborator)
    obj.collaborator = collaborator

    obj.my_awesome_method

    collaborator.should have_received(3.times).some_interesting_method("Some", "arguments")
  end

See also the cucumber feature, easily viewable at http://relishapp.com/Mortice/matahari

== KNOWN ISSUES/TODO:

* Stubbing implementation is incredibly basic
* Not very usable at all for test/unit users (but this is easily fixed with an assert_received method)
* No support for argument matchers - arguments must match exactly via == or not at all
* We need to be able to remote-control BMWs.

== INSTALL:

* gem install matahari

== ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

* David Chelimsky, for putting up with my 'robust' criticisms of RSpec mocks
* Aslak Helles√∏y, for giving interesting feedback on an early version
* Szczepan Faber, for creating Mockito
* Brian Takita, for creating RR
